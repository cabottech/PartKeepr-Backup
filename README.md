# PartKeepr-Backup

A Linux shell script that creates a backup of a [PartKeepr](https://github.com/partkeepr/PartKeepr) database and important web files. Backups are conveniently compressed using zip to date-time-stamped filenames.

Tested with [PartKeepr 1.4.0 on Raspbian 9.13 (stretch)](https://wiki.partkeepr.org/wiki/PartKeepr_1.4.0_installation_on_a_Raspberry_Pi)

## Installation

This script is intended to work with [PartKeepr 1.4.0 on Raspbian 9.13 (stretch)](https://wiki.partkeepr.org/wiki/PartKeepr_1.4.0_installation_on_a_Raspberry_Pi). Ensure this is installed and running.

Install prerequisites:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install git zip
```

Change to the home directory and clone from git:

```bash
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/cabottech/PartKeepr-Backup.git
```

Change to the script directory and set permissions to execute the script:

```bash
cd PartKeepr-Backup
chmod +x partkeepr-backup.sh
```

Set the database and file properties (see [Configuration](##Configuration) for details):

```bash
nano partkeepr-backup.properties
```

## Configuration

Settings can be modified in the `partkeepr-backup.properties` file.

You'll need to set the database connection and file locations properties specific to your system and installation.

Ensure the user has permissions to read/write to the `backup_root_path`.

Note: it is recommended that `backup_root_path` be set to a location *not* on the Raspberry Pi's SD card. A safer location for backups would be a mounted USB drive, or mounted network folder. This ensures that in the event of SD card corruption or fault, the backups aren't also lost.

## How to use

### From command-line

Run a backup:

```bash
cd ~/PartKeepr-Backup
./partkeepr-backup.sh
```

### From cron

To automate the backup each day:

```bash
crontab -e
```

Add the following line to schedule a backup at 2:15AM each day. Adjust to your install path if needed:

```bash
15 2 * * * cd /home/pi/PartKeepr-Backup && /bin/sh ./partkeepr-backup.sh
```

### Storing backups on a network share folder

The following is a simple example of mounting a CIFS/SAMBA network share folder and configuring this as the backup storage location.

First, create a mount location:

```bash
sudo mkdir /mnt/backups
```

Mount the network share folder:

Options:

- `//fileserver.local/backups/PartKeepr` is the path to an existing network share folder. An IP address can also be used, i.e. `//192.168.1.123/backups/PartKeepr`.
- `username=remoteuser` is to authenticate with the file server (you will be prompted for a password if applicable)
- `uid=pi` is to set local user `pi` as the owner of the share to allow read/write access.
- `noexec` disables executing anything from the share location (an optional safety precaution).

```bash
sudo mount -t cifs //fileserver.local/backups/PartKeepr /mnt/backups -o username=remoteuser,uid=pi,noexec
```

Enter your network share password when prompted.

Now that we have the network share connected, `partkeepr-backup.preferences` can be set accordingly. Update the backup location:

```bash
backup_root_path=/mnt/backups
```

Run a backup to check this is all working:

```bash
cd ~/PartKeepr-Backup
./partkeepr-backup.sh
```

The backup files should be now stored the network share folder.

If the network share folder is required to be auto-mounted on Raspberry Pi boot, the `/etc/fstab` file can be configured (this is beyond the scope of this example).

## What it does

When the script `partkeepr-backup.sh` is run (i.e. from command-line or cronjob), backups are created, archived to ZIP, and stored as date-time-stamped files.

### Backup location

Upon execution the backup path is created based on the 'backup_root_path' property. A 'Year-Month' subdirectory is created to help to keep backups organised.

Example:

- `/home/pi/PartKeepr-Backup/backups/202009/`

The backups and log will be stored in this directory.

### Database backup

A backup of the database is done using mysqldump. This creates an SQL export of the entire PartKeepr database. This is then ZIP archived and given a date-time specific filename.

Example:

- `20200905-100952_partkeepr-database-backup.sql.zip`

### Filesystem backup

The data and config web directories are ZIP archived and given date-time specific filenames.

Example:

- `20200905-100952_partkeepr-data-backup.sql.zip`
- `20200905-100952_partkeepr-config-backup.sql.zip`

### Backup log

A log of the backup process is written to the backup location.

Example:

- `20200905-100952_partkeepr-backup.log`

This log details the date of the backup, files written, backup size, and duration.

Example log output:

```text
PartKeepr Backup 0.1.3

## Notes / improvements / to-do

- Currently backups are full snapshots, not incremental. This is nice and simple, but uses much more backup storage. It may be worth automatically removing old backups? For the time being backup storage need to be managed by the user.
- Send backup error notifications via syslog/mail?
- Add a step-by-step guide for backup recovery.
